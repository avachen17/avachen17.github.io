                    <p>
                        If you want to draw your favorite anime character or even one of your own, designing the body can seem like a challenge. Anime characters can vary in shape and size, but start by drawing them with human proportions before modifying them into your own design. While proportions are similar between male and female characters, their body shapes vary slightly. With a bit of time and practice, you’ll be able to draw any sort of anime character!
                        </p>

                        <li><p>Place a circle near the top center of the page so there’s enough room to add hair later on. Put the point of the chin slightly outside the bottom edge of the circle since the jaw will come lower down. Sketch in curved jaw lines from either side of the circle toward the mark you just made to make a pointed chin for your anime girl.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Work lightly in pencil so you can erase and make changes if you need to.</li>
                            <li>If you have trouble drawing a circle, use a compass to help you draw one.</li>
                            <li>Don’t add any facial features yet since you may need to make adjustments to the size of the head later on.</li>

                    </li>
                        <li><p>Measure the height of the head from the top of the circle to the point of the chin. Start your line at the top of your character’s head and draw it straight down so it’s 6 ½ taller than the head. Space horizontal marks down the vertical line so they’re the same distance apart as the head height to use as guides.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Measure your proportions each time or else your anime character won’t look natural.</li>
                            <li>The guide line will also help keep your drawing symmetrical.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                        <li><p>Draw the top line of the hourglass shape slightly below the chin to form the shoulders. Draw curved lines going toward the center line, and flare out the bottom of the hourglass shape so it’s slightly wider than the shoulders for the hips. Draw 2 circles with a compass in the top half of the hourglass shape for your character’s chest.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When you’re finished, the head and torso together will be about 3 heads tall.</li>
                            <li>Your anime girl’s shoulders should be about 1 ½ times wider than the head.</li>
                            <li>Draw small circles on the top corners of the hourglass shape if you want to visualize the shoulder joints better.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                        <li><p>Draw tubes extending down from the shoulder joints on the top of the torso. Once you reach the point where the body is it’s narrowest, put circles inside the tubes you’re drawing for the arms to mark the elbows. Continue extending the tubes down to the bottom of the hourglass and sketch small circles for the wrists. Draw mitten shapes for the hands attached to the ends of the arms.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The upper arms and forearms on your drawing will be the same length.</li>
                            <li>Try posing the arms a different way if you don’t want them straight down. Just make sure the total length of each arm is about the same length as the drawing’s torso.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                        <li><p>Start by drawing tubes extending from the bottom of the torso on either side of the center guide line. Once the upper legs are 1 ½ heads tall, draw circles in the tubes to represent the knee joints. Continue drawing the lower legs so they’re the same length as the upper legs before adding circles for the ankle joints. Draw trapezoid shapes attached to the ankle joints for your character’s feet so the bottoms line up with the last horizontal line.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make sure both legs are the same length or else your drawing won’t look symmetrical.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                        <li><p>Use a small eraser to clean up the extra lines on your drawing. Erase the center line running through the middle of your character and any horizontal guides you drew to figure out the proportions.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Be careful not to erase the outline for your character or else you’ll have to redraw it.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                        <li><p>Place the eyes just below the center of the circle add eyebrows slightly above them. Add the nose and eyes below the eyes in the middle of the face. Choose a hairstyle for your anime character and draw it in clumps rather than individual strands.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Look at various characters’ hairstyles to get an idea of different anime hair that you can draw.</li>
                            <li>Draw the hairstyles on a piece of tracing paper on top of your drawing so you can practice sketching without affecting the rest of your drawing. That way, you can try multiple styles before committing to one.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                        <li><p>There are many different outfits you can draw on your character, so choose one that looks the best for your drawing. Lightly sketch the clothes on your character’s body so you can get an idea of what it will look like. Once you find a style you like for your character, erase any lines from the body that are covered by clothes to clean up your drawing.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>    Look at pictures of real people wearing the kind of clothes you want to draw on your character so you can see where it folds and bunches up so you can make your drawing more realistic.</li>
