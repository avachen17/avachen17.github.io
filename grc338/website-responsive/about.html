    <figcaption>Ava takes pride in her hard work and dedication to coffee and productivity.</figcaption>

            <p>It all began in 1977 when Ava purchased a convenience store in the heart of the Mission District. She treated her customers with niceness and respect, always paying attention to their needs. She understood that if you put people first, you cannot fail. In her off-hours, she blended and tested brews, trying to make the perfect cup of coffee. After 25 years of experimenting, Ava moved her kitchen table into the convenience store and Cafe Ava was born. From its first day, Cafe Ava was about quality and care, warmth and connection. This is what makes Cafe Ava feel like home. It’s not just about coffee—it’s about people.</p>
